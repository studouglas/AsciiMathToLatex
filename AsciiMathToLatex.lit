@title Hello world in Swift

@s Introduction

This is an example hello world program.
We can define codeblocks with `---`

--- main.swift
@{Imports}
@{Print a string}
---

Now we can define the `Imports` codeblock:

--- Imports
import Foundation
---

Finally, our program needs to print "hello world"

--- Print a string
println("hello world")
---
