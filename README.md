# AsciiMathToLatex
Compiler written in Swift using literate programming to convert AsciiMath statements to LaTeX.

# Installation Guide
All the source code for *AsciiMathToLatex* as well as all the documentation (including this document) were created using [Literate](http://literate.zbyedidia.webfactional.com), a tool for writing programs using the [literate programming](http://www.literateprogramming.com) method. That means that the source code is contained alongside the documentation within the <code>.lit</code> files. Running the Literate program will generate both the <code>.swift</code> source files that make up the project and the HTML files that form the documentation. After the <code>.swift</code> files are generated by Literate, the Swift compiler is used to create the executable.

# Literate
Download and install Literate from their [downloads page](http://literate.zbyedidia.webfactional.com/download.php)

# Swift Compiler
-OS X users can install the swift compiler, <code>swiftc</code>, by installing [Xcode](https://www.google.ca/search?client=safari&rls=en&q=install+xcode&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8&gfe_rd=cr&ei=7hn_VravBYON8QfU77HgDg)<br>
-Linux users can install Swift from the compiler [homepage](https://swift.org/getting-started/#using-the-repl) 

# AsciiMathToLatex
1. Navigate to the project directory in the Terminal
2. Generate the source code and documentation from the Literate files by running 'lit *.lit'
3. Compile the swift files with 'xcrun swiftc -sdk $(xcrun --show-sdk-path --sdk macosx) *.swift -o AsciiMathToLatex'
